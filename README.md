# Anti-Trans Bills in the U.S., 2018-23
Data analysis of anti-trans and -nonbinary bills in U.S. state legislatures from 2018-23.

An early draft analysis using [publicly-available](https://tracktranslegislation.com) [datasets](https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights) that I modified for this analysis.

The latest published version of the analysis can always be found [here](https://rpubs.com/kaince/anti-trans-bills).

For the merged and cleaned dataset of anti-trans legislation from 2018-April 2023, including classifications and status of bills obtained from [the ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights) and [Track Trans Legislation](https://tracktranslegislation.com), use [this csv file](https://github.com/kaince/anti-trans-bills/blob/main/data/bills_18_23.csv).
